# BioImageTools

Shared GitHub organization for OME-Zarr work.

This org was created at the 2023 [Next generation bioimage analysis workflows hackathon](https://www.ema.uzh.ch/en/register/biovisioncenter-hackathon.html) held at the BioVisionCenter at UZH, 
for the purposes of continuing collaboration and innovation on [NGFF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01326-w)-based and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) image processing workflows. 
Continued at the [2024 OME-NGFFworkflows hackathon](https://biovisioncenter.notion.site/OME-NGFF-Workflows-Hackathon-2024-dde32a032adf49b4a53b4b014586b678 )
