# BioImageTools

Shared GitHub organization created at the 2023 "Next generation bioimage analysis workflows hackathon" held at UZH Irchel, 
for the purposes of continuing collaboration and innovation on [NGFF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01326-w)-based and [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) image processing workflows. 

## We are interested in...
* Bioimage tools which consume and/or produce OME-Zarr
* OCI containers 
* Nextflow modules and subworkflows
* Galaxy integrations
* Fractal integrations
* OME-Zarr usage examples
